        /// (when the offline noun feed is empty). Therefore, the scroll view must be removed using a view modifier whenever the noun feed
        /// is empty in order to show the empty placeholder view.
        ///
        /// In the case that there are nouns, the scroll view will be re-added. Since we want the navigation bar (navigation title + right *New* button)
        /// to scroll with the content as well, the preference key for setting the navigation bar items must be **inside** the `ScrollView`, which is
        /// why the `OffChainNounsFeed` takes in an optional `navigationTitle` and `navigationRightBarItem` so that the appropriate
        /// preference values can be set from within the feed.

        /// Ideally, the `SlotMachine` should be fixed so that there is no weird behaviour when it's inside a `ScrollView`, but a solution
